BIRTHDAYS




Compare whether millenials or generation z born people are more 'normal'...according to Pisces. Use modulo arithmetic to comprise a distance metric indexed from the 

Pisces birth range. Use welch's to determine which population is less astrologicaly distant from Pisces-kind on average.

When we take equivalent length subsets from Generation-z and Millenial births, which generation has the lower astrological distance on average?

GOLF

Comparison of elite Driving vs elite Putting as evidenced by scoring. (It is a common notion that putting is more important). Sample - 2020 pga tour 
Does the subset of elite drivers(as measured by driving accuracy and/or driving distance) (Welch's to determine which metric or create new metric)
perform worse than the subset of elite putters (measured by putting 'strokes gained') when it comes to overall score?

MUSIC

I found a site that has a database of the theory behind popular songs. I would like to run a hypothesis tests that the average song in the billboard100 
(or some other list of top songs, maybe even of all time) is in the key of C. First I would have to scrape the database. (I'm not sure what this would yield as i've
never scraped a database). I would hope to get categorical or numeric data concerning the key of the song, and then merge that database with a billboard or 
top hits database. I would then perform a two tailed hypothesis test.
